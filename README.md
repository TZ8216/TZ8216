# 🧲 Multivariable Calculus × Electromagnetism

A visual + conceptual overview of how multivariable calculus theorems (divergence, curl, integral theorems) connect deeply with the core of electromagnetism, including Maxwell's equations. This notebook is designed for self-learners, AP Physics C / Calc BC students, or anyone preparing for college-level E&M or vector calculus.
